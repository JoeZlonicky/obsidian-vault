### Description
There are limitations of using an RDBMS that should be kept in mind:
* Complexity: set-up and management can be complex, especially for large applications
* Cost: maintaining an RDBMS can be expensive in both fees and computer resources
* Fixed schema: a rigid schema means certain changes are time-consuming and complicated
* Poor handling of unstructured data: an RDBMS is not optimised for unstructured data like multimedia files or sensor data.
* Poor horizontal scalability: not as easily horizontally scalable as NoSQL databases
