IDEs (like Visual Studio or CLion) almost always have built-in debuggers for identifying code that is responsible for access violation errors.

Valgrind is a popular tool for detecting memory leaks and access violations in C++ programs.

AddressSanitizer is a runtime memory error detector for C++ that can detect out-of-bounds accesses, memory leaks, and use-after-free errors.
