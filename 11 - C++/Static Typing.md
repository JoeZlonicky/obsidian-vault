### Description
C++ is a statically typed language, meaning the data type of variable is determined at compile time. This allows for type checking during compilation, raising errors before the program is even run.

### Examples
```c++
int main() {
	int number = 7.2f;  // Error! Assigning float to an integer variable!
	return 0;
}
```
