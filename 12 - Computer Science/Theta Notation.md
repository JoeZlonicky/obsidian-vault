Represents both the upper bound (i.e. worst-case) and lower bound (i.e. best-case) of the runtime efficiency of an algorithm. It is used to analyze the average-case complexity of an algorithm.

A function f(n) belongs to the set O(g(n)) if there exists a positive constants c1 and c2 such that it lies between c1g(n) and c2g(n) for all n >= n0.
