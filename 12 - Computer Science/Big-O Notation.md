### Description
Represents the upper bound (i.e. worst-case) of the runtime efficiency of an algorithm.

A function f(n) belongs to the set O(g(n)) if there exists a positive constant c such that it lies between 0 and cg(n) for all n >= n0.

Big-O notation is frequently used to decide what the best algorithm for a specific scenario is.
