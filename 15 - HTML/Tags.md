### Description
Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

It's worth noting that some tags like [[Line Breaks]] and [[Images]] are self-closing tags as they don't wrap any content.
### Examples
```html
<p>Hello, <br/>world!</p>
```
Here `<p>` and `</p>` are opening and closing paragraph tags. `<br/>` is a self-closing tag.
